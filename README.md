## üìåNotes for beginners to get started:
1. Complete **2-3 labs on per day basis**, else, you won't be able to complete the tracks on time.

2. Since every lab has some time limit within which that lab needs to be completed, it's good knowing about that particular lab previously. 

3. Do read the **lab documentation** properly to be able to answer the MCQ questions.

4. If got stuck while completing labs and have less remaining time, make the use of online blogs to complete the tracks on time(be smart).

5. Try to pass a lab at max in **3 attempts**.

6. In case of any query, one can reach **GDSC BIT Sindri members**, and they will help you.

7. Those registered students who will not be able to complete either one or both the tracks will get deprived of his/her participation in future events from the facilitator's end as we will be strictly monitoring your activity.
(You are among the fortunate ones who got registered successfully but many people did not get the chance this time so please don't miss the opportunity.)
